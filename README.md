# Multi-Currency Formatter

A small Android library that dynamically reformats user input (from an `EditText`) for displaying currency values in any locale or currency. Java's `DecimalFormat` is used for formatting the numbers derived from user input.

## Requirements

- Android 4.1 (API 16)

## Installation

Add Jitpack to your project build.gralde file
 
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Then add this dependency to your app build.gradle file.

```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.adawoud:BottomSheetTimeRangePicker:latest-release'
}
```

## Configuration

The MultiCurrencyFormatter allows configuration for the following fields/behaviors:

1. Currency: Java Currency class used for formatting currency text values
2. Currency symbol: Custom symbol to override the symbol associated with the Currency
3. Locale: Locale used for formatting currency text values
4. Resize text automatically
5. Superscript the currency symbol

The following code snippet shows how to configure each field/behavior:

```
MultiCurrencyFormatter.newInstance(viewLifecycleOwner, editText)
    .setCurrency(Currency.getInstance(Locale.JAPAN))
    .setLocale(Locale.US)
    .setSymbol("ðŸ’¸") 
    .setAutoResize(true)
    .setSymbolSuperscript(true)
```
